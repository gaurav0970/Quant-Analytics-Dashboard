## AI Usage Transparency

This document outlines how artificial intelligence (AI) assisted in developing this **Quant Analytics Platform**. AI was used as a productivity tool to accelerate development, with all generated output reviewed, validated, and implemented by the developer.

## AI Assistance Summary

AI models (including **ChatGPT** and **Claude**) were used to support the following areas:

- **Architecture & Setup**  
  - Generating initial project structure  
  - Drafting Docker and environment configuration templates  

- **Analytics Engine**  
  - Assisting with implementations of statistical models such as:
    - Kalman Filters  
    - Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression  

- **Backend API**  
  - Creating boilerplate code for:
    - FastAPI REST endpoints  
    - WebSocket servers  

- **Frontend Dashboard**  
  - Providing layout examples  
  - Supplying Plotly chart configurations for the Streamlit interface  

- **Documentation**  
  - Helping structure the initial README  
  - Assisting with technical explanations and summaries

## Human-Led Development

All critical engineering decisions and final implementations were driven by human expertise, including:

- Final system architecture and technology selection  
- End-to-end design and integration of the platform  
- Implementation of all business logic, including:
  - Custom alerting system  
  - Data ingestion and processing pipeline  
- Debugging, performance optimization, and validation of analytics  
- Review, testing, and refinement of all AI-assisted code

## Conclusion

AI functioned strictly as a **development assistant**, generating patterns, suggestions, and boilerplate to improve development speed. The final architecture, critical integrations, and overall product quality are the result of deliberate human engineering judgment, oversight, and validation.
